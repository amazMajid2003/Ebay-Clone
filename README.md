# eBay Clone Project

## Project Overview
This project is an eBay clone, designed as a mobile application using Android Studio and Kotlin. It replicates the core functionality of the popular e-commerce platform eBay, including user authentication, product browsing, and user profiles. The current version of the application features static designs for the home, sign-in, sign-up, and profile screens, with plans to make these screens dynamic and responsive in future updates.

## Setup Instructions
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amazMajid2003/Ebay-Clone.git
   ```

2. **Open the project in Android Studio:**
   - Launch Android Studio.
   - Click on "Open an existing project" and select the cloned directory.

3. **Build the project:**
   - In Android Studio, click on "Build" in the toolbar and select "Make Project" to compile the app.

4. **Run the application:**
   - Connect an Android device or start an Android emulator.
   - Click the "Run" button to install the app on your device/emulator.

## Screens Designed

### 1. Home Screen
   - Displays an initial product list and navigation options for users to browse items (static at this stage).

### 2. Sign-In Screen
   - Allows existing users to log into their accounts (currently non-functional, static design only).

### 3. Sign-Up Screen
   - Provides a registration form for new users to create an account (static design).

### 4. Profile Screen
   - Displays user profile information such as name, email, and other account details (static design).

In future updates, these screens will become fully functional with API integrations and dynamic user data.

## Technical Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring a responsive UI across different screen sizes is an ongoing challenge. Currently, the designs are static and will need significant adjustment to become fully responsive.

- **Kotlin Development:** While Kotlin provides many powerful features, adapting to the language nuances, especially around handling Android lifecycle events and data binding, posed some challenges during development.

- **Authentication Integration:** Although not yet implemented, integrating authentication (OAuth, Firebase, or custom backend) will be a significant technical hurdle in future updates.

## Future Plans

- **Dynamic Screens:** Convert the static screens into fully responsive designs that can handle different screen sizes and orientations.

- **User Authentication:** Implement sign-in and sign-up functionality using a backend service.

- **Product Listings and Search:** Integrate product search and filtering functionalities to enhance the user experience.

- **Profile Management:** Allow users to view and edit their profile information dynamically.

- **Backend Integration:** Connect the application to a backend service for handling user data, product listings, and orders.

Stay tuned for future updates as we work towards making this eBay clone fully functional!
